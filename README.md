### Summary

This backend has already completed our main features by using Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services. Firsly, Weco deployed Azure Cognitive Service on Azure portal. Secondly, we brainstormed to choosing technologies from Azure services, then selected some API services from Microsof Azure Cognitive Services to tackle our issues and develop our solutions.
In order to develop our solutions that mentioned in [project proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FYdHjCYG57b0U-Go4lhKOeZSk-0WucPX/view), we implemented these features: 
+ Speech to Text API [source code](https://github.com/JuntionXSeoul2020Telepasee/TelepaSee-Backend/tree/master/STT)
+ Text to Speech API [source code](https://github.com/JuntionXSeoul2020Telepasee/TelepaSee-Backend/tree/master/STT)
+ Translation that implemented 2 languages English and Korean [source code](https://github.com/JuntionXSeoul2020Telepasee/TelepaSee-Backend/tree/master/translation)

### Future Plan

Because of the short time, we have just implemented 3 features from Microsoft Azure Cognitive Service and we have a plan to implement other features from Azure to improve this project such as Azure databases and Azure server in the future.
